With Israeli strikes targeting Gaza for days now, BBC Verify has been trying to assess the scale of destruction.

One of the heaviest-hit areas appears to be Rimal - a busy residential neighbourhood in northern Gaza.

As these satellite images show, many buildings in the area were destroyed between 9 and 10 October.

Visual clues in the images - such as the remaining buildings and the road patterns - have been matched up with older satellite imagery to confirm the location.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says certain areas were targeted because they were used “by operatives in the anti-tank force of the terrorist organisation”.
